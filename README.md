##Exercise 1: Learningmarkdown syntax with dillinger.io

I spent a good portion of my time throughly going through the site. It was interesting to see the how one screen mimicked the other. I thought the program isn't as user friendly as Word. It's interesting to see how other softwares worked. Definatly liked this exercise more other the later ones, as it was a lot more clear. It also took some time for the whole inserting images thing, that was totally different.

##Exercise 2: Getting familiar with DHBox

My first reaction was how intimidating the program was. It just looks like all codes. I felt frustrated that it wasn’t as simple as you type what you want. I’m still new to all these terms so I’m still having difficulty grasping everything.

#### Mistakes
1. Somehow created an account for 1 week, so I had to go back and do one for a month.

##Exercise 3: setting up your github space

Some more terminology to learn. Still nervous using the program. I'm finding myself still taking a lot longer to do everything. I'm trying to take my time to try to learn it all, but I don't grasp information if I'm not spending hours doing a project per say. 

_Terms to Remember

>repository: a single folder that holds all of the files and subfolders of your project
commit: this means, 'take a snapshot of the current state of my repository'
publish: take a folder on my computer, and copy it and its contents to the web as a repository at github.com/myusername/repositoryname
sync: update the web repository with the latest commit from the folder on my computer
branch: make a copy of my repository with a 'working name'
merge: fold the changes I have made on a branch into another branch (typically, either master or gh-pages)
fork: to make a copy of someone else's repo
clone: to copy a repo online onto your own computer
pull request: to ask the original maker of a repo to 'pull' your changes into their master, original, repository
push: to move your changes from your computer to the online repo

###Exercise 4: a detailed look at using git on the command line

Still feel overwhelmed by all the numbers and letters on the screen but slowly getting by. I am having a lot of trouble learning this program. I should of began doing my fail log earlier but I'm trying to do this all in chuncks rather than rush it.
My current problem right now is understanding the instructions in git clone.
When it says "when you're inside it, and the changes will show up on your own copy" I don't understand how to get into it? I tried scrolling up to see. I'm just going to keep going over it and press some more buttons because the information on the screen is formatted so oddly. There just so much going on so I find it's hard to grasp.

##Overall
This week's work took longer than expected but I did really enjoy the articles. I enjoyed reading them more than last weeks. I just felt like I could relate to them more.
